# Intro
I'm Kaushik - a 21-year-old AI developer and undergrad CS student at UWaterloo. I'm especially passionate about responsible AI development, with ethical alignment and interpretability being especially areas of interest. I have significant experience working with generative models in both research and applied settings, as well as working with more traditional ML techniques such as linear and tree-based algorithms. 
- ðŸ”­ I recently interned as a Forward Deployed Engineer at Baseten, where I worked on productionizing generative models for mission-critical workloads for our customers, optimizing models to ensure that they are as performant and reliable as possible.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about model optimization techniques and alternatives to transformer-based architectures.
- ðŸ’¬ Always happy to chat regarding anything AI, ethics, or economics.
